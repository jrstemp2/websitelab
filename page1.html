            I usualy develope using C#. I really enjoy making console applications and I am currently learning how to make
            <br />web applications. My IDE of choice is Visual Studio. I do have some experience with Python 3 from a college course I enrolled in.
            <br /> I used IDLE to develope with. As for GTNL5 and CSS3, I tooka  course on these as well and used Notepad++.
            <br /> This is ny first time using Visual Studio to create a web page. Outside of class and work, I do a lot of self study. <br />

            I have several hobbies, but my main hobby is collecting and playing videogames. I usually coolect 8 and 16 bit games and consoles.
            <br /> I believe this is mostly from the nostolgia i get from collecting since these are games from my childhood. I play a lot of modern games as well.
            <br /> my toddler and I enjoy the newer Pokemon games.

        <p>
            I grew up and still live in Sterling Heights, MI. It's a nice place to live but it is very busy. I like being very close to everything.
            <br />my area is filled with restaurants and has a lot of really nice parks. I enjoy hiking the trails and visiting local restaurants with my
            <br />family. We really have a lot of lebanese food, which I have really developed a liking for.
